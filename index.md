# Welcome to My Page

Hello there. My name is Luke Keating. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with the class of 2021. I double majored with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Psychology. I like to make things that are fun to and can put a smile on someone's face. I made this page to share some of my favorite projects. If you would like to see my projects in more detail, you can visit them in their entirety [here](https://github.com/pooiy2).

//TODO:Move this paragraph into seal respository instead of introductory page.
I collaborated on this robot seal as my final project for my Psych 112R (Cognitive Robotics) class. We were given open ended instructions on what we could build for the final project. My group decided to create a socially assistive robot, something we had been introduced to in the class. Zili Zhong built the robot, Gianna Bandoni sewed the seal, and I wrote the code. The seal learns behavior using a genetic algorithm. When the seal is turned on, it initializes with random flipper behavior. Its behavior can be positively reinforced when the seal is pet on the head, noted by a purr, and negatively reinforced when the seal is pinched on the tail, noted by a growl. As the user interacts with the seal, the seal will learn to behave in a way to garners the highest amount of positive attention.  

The seal was one of the most fun projects to work on. Most of my projects remain in the digital world. It was nice to see a project in the real world and be able to interact with it.

# Dartboard

This was another fun project to work on. I was getting tired of sitting indoors and doing nothing all day during the pandemic so I decided to create an interactive project. This project led to some very fun family nights with the large projector in the living room.

# Christmas Lights

I didn't do any coding for this project but it was too much fun to leave off (I may just want to show off my Christmas lights). I did learn a lot about using a raspberry pi and creating a local network. I also soldered for the first time in my personal life. Who knew that the one engineering course I took my freshman year would come in handy!

# So Many Bots

//Add video

Who knew writing bots could be so much fun. I've made more than I can count. Some of them were quite practical while others were chaotic. My favorite bot was the one that would send my cousin a random poem every 30 minutes. That's what he gets for ignoring my phone calls.
