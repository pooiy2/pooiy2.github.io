# Welcome to My Page

Hello there. My name is Luke Keating. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with the class of 2021. I double majored with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Psychology. I like to make things that are fun to and can put a smile on someone's face. I made this page to share some of my favorite projects. If you would like to see my projects in more detail, you can visit them in their entirety [here](https://github.com/pooiy2). You can also check out my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEbBAFWX7JU9GU9sdO4X7wVq8aKU3a-DQR1_kq-1bhI/edit?usp=sharing).

The seal was one of the most fun projects to work on. Most of my projects remain in the digital world. It was nice to see a project in the real world and be able to interact with it.

This was another fun project to work on. I was getting tired of sitting indoors and doing nothing all day during the pandemic so I decided to create an interactive project. This project led to some very fun family nights with the large projector in the living room.

# Christmas Lights

I didn't do any coding for this project but it was too much fun to leave off (I may just want to show off my Christmas lights). I did learn a lot about using a raspberry pi and creating a local network. I also soldered for the first time in my personal life. Who knew that the one engineering course I took my freshman year would come in handy!

# Health App

This project was more on the practical side of things. I collaborated on a mobile application that determines the users risk for heart disease. It inputs the phones sensor data into a Bayes classifier in order to give an estimate of your heart disease risk. 

# Web Drivers

At the start of the pandemic I taught a few friends how to code in Python. As part of the course I demonstarted a Python bot using Selenium to automate sending text messages to people. It was gratifying to see my friends' exitement over the newfound possibilities that arised from this demonstration.

# Future Projects

I'm always looking for the next thing to do. Stay tuned here if you want to see more.
