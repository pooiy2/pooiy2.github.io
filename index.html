    <h1>Luke Keating's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to My Page</h2>
        <p>Hello there. My name is Luke Keating. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with the class of 2021. 
          I double majored with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Psychology. I like to make things that are fun to and can 
          put a smile on someoneâ€™s face. I made this page to share some of my favorite projects. If you would like to see my 
          projects in more detail, you can visit them in their entirety here. You can also check out my resume here.</p>
