    <h1>Luke T. Keating's Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to My Page</h2>
    <p>
      Hello there. My name is Luke Keating. I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with the class of 2021. 
      I double majored with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Psychology. I like to make things that are fun to and can 
      put a smile on someone’s face. I made this page to share some of my favorite projects. If you would like to see my 
      projects in more detail, you can visit them in their entirety here. You can also check out my resume here.

    <h2>Robot Seal</h2>
    <p>

      The seal was one of the most fun projects to work on. Most of my projects remain in the digital world. It was 
      nice to see a project in the real world and be able to interact with it.

    <h2>Dartboard</h2>

    I didn’t do any coding for this project but it was too much fun to leave off (I may just want to show off my Christmas lights). I did learn a lot about using 
    a raspberry pi and creating a local network. I also soldered for the first time in my personal life. Who knew that the one engineering course I took my freshman 
    year would come in handy!

    <h2><a name="Health App">Health App</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="#Health App">Check Your Risk!</a>
    <br/>
    This project was more on the practical side of things. I collaborated on a mobile application that determines the users risk for heart disease. It inputs the 
    phones sensor data into a Bayes classifier in order to give an estimate of your heart disease risk.
    </p>
    <h2>Web Drivers</h2>
    <p>
      At the start of the pandemic I taught a few friends how to code in Python. As part of the course I demonstarted a Python bot using Selenium to automate sending 
      text messages to people. It was gratifying to see my friends' exitement over the newfound possibilities that arised from this demonstration.
    </p>
    <h2>Future Projects</h2>
    <p>
      I’m always looking for the next thing to do. Stay tuned here if you want to see more.
